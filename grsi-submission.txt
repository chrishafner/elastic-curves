Title: The Design Space of Plane Elastic Curves
Authors: Christian Hafner, Bernd Bickel
OS: Windows 10


Dependencies:
 - Matlab (tested on version 2021a)
 - Gurobi (tested on version 8)

 
Setup Instructions:
 - After installing Matlab and Gurobi, execute the script 'gurobi_setup.m', located in the directory '[gurobi-directory]/win64/matlab' from within Matlab. This will give Matlab access to the Gurobi interface.
 - Execute the command 'savepath' from within Matlab, so Gurobi remains accessible even after Matlab is closed and reopened.

 
Figure Generation Script:
 - Within Matlab, navigate to the folder '[elastic-rods-repository]/matlab' and run the script 'script_master.m'. The script will take approximately 80 seconds to run.
 
 
Reproduction of Results:
 - The script will produce a total of 37 Matlab figures, reproducing most of the results-related figures shown in the publication. Each Matlab figure can be matched to the figure/demo in the publication via its title.
 - Figs. 6-10, 15, 17-20, 22 are reproduced. In some cases, the figures have been lightly edited for publication, such as color changes, reordering, scaling, pruning.
 - In addition, renderings of the simulation outcome underlying the physical models from Fig. 1 (left), and Fig. 24 (top right) are shown, as well as fabrication plans for the models "Pavilion", "Horse", "Shell", "Flower Pot", as discussed in Section 9.
